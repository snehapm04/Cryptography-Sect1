# Cryptography

## Section 1: Introduction to Cryptography and Zero Knowledge Proofs (ZKP)

### Overview
This section introduces cryptography, focusing on securing data through concepts like encryption, decryption, and hashing. We then explore Zero Knowledge Proofs (ZKP), which allow one party to prove knowledge of a secret without revealing the secret itself. Finally, we dive into ZK-SNARK, which enables non-interactive proof generation and verification.

### Topics Covered
- **Cryptography Basics**: Understanding encryption, hashing, and secure data communication.
- **Zero Knowledge Proofs (ZKP)**: A method of proving knowledge without revealing the underlying data.
- **Hashing Functions**: MD5 and SHA-256 hashing explained with practical examples.
- **ZK-SNARK**: Generating and verifying proofs without interaction between prover and verifier.

### Tools Used
- **Zokrates**: A tool for generating and verifying ZK-SNARK proofs.
- **SHA-256 Generator**: Online tools to explore cryptographic hash functions.
